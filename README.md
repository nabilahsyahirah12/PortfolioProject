## Data Cleaning & Preparation

### During the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed:

- Data loading and inspection.
- Handling missing values.
- Data cleaning and standardizing.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### The EDA focused on exploring the layoffs data to address key questions, such as:

- Which top 3 industry experienced the highest number of layoffs?
- Which company had the most layoffs?
- Which year saw the highest total layoffs?
- Which country had the highest total layoffs?

## Results/Findings:

- The top 3 industries experienced the highest number of layoffs are consumer, retail and transportation.
- The company that had the most layoffs is Amazon with a staggering amount of 18150 employees.
- The year that has the highest total layoffs is on 2022 with 160661 laid off employees.
- The country that had the highest total layoffs is United States, followed by India and Netherlands.

## Limitations:

- Inconsistent data formats that require standardization, which may lead to inaccurate grouping if not properly addressed.
- Handling missing data entries requires manual cleaning, which can introduce potential errors during data querying.
- Decisions about which data to include or exclude in the analysis may skew results, especially if outliers are removed without a clear rationale.
